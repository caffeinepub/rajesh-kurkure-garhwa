  "summary": "The BuildRequest only asks to display \"Mobile: 9973279335\" in the global footer on all pages. The diff summary suggests App.tsx was modified and mentions the footer in a generated summary file, but the provided truncated App.tsx snippet does not show any footer JSX or the exact required text, so implementation of REQ-2 cannot be verified from the included evidence. Additionally, App.tsx appears to include (or adds) admin order toast notification behavior and a Phone icon import, which are not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The only code shown for frontend/src/App.tsx is truncated before any footer markup; there is no visible JSX proving that a global footer exists/was modified to include the exact text \"Mobile: 9973279335\" across all app states. The separate frontend-file-summaries.txt claims it exists, but that is not the actual component implementation.",
